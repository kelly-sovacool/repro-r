# Reproducible R

Making your research projects reproducible ensures that anyone,
whether that's another scientist reading your publication or you six months from now,
can use the same methods and data to find the same results.
Reproducible research is not only a good practice to validate results and to allow others to build off prior work,
it also makes your life easier when you need to update software,
try out different parameters in a pipeline, or find bugs in your code!

- **Reproducibility** is the ability to regenerate a result with the same data set and data analysis pipeline.
- **Replicability** is the ability to produce a consistent result with an independent experiment asking the same scientific question.
