## Defining reproducibility

- **Reproducibilty** is the ability to get the same result with the same data set and the same methods
- **Replicability** is the ability to get the same result with a different data set using the same methods

:::{.notes}
- reproducibilty - the ability to get the same result with the same data set and the same methods
- replicability - the ability to get the same result with a different data set using the same methods
- robustness
- generalizability
- reusability
:::

## What is reproducibility

| Methods           | Same data       | Different data    |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Same methods      | Reproducibility | Replicability     |
| Different methods | Robustness      | Generalizability  |

## Why care about reproducibility? {.hidden}

## Reproducibility is a spectrum {.hidden}

If you tried to reproduce a well-known research paper in your field:

- Would you come to the same conclusion?
- How many hours of work would it take you to repeat the analysis?
- How close would the statistical estimates be between the original and the reproduction?

## Is your work reproducible?

:::{.fragment}
For peers in your field?
:::

:::{.fragment}
For your colleagues?
:::

:::{.fragment}
For _yourself_?
:::

::::{.notes}
- Someone reads your paper and wants to take inspiration from your work.
  Could someone else in your field take your code and data and get the same results?
- A colleague wants to use your methods and apply if to their own dataset.
- If you took a break from your project and came back to it 6 months later, could you easily pick up where you left off?
- If your computer crashed, could you immediately reproduce your analysis and continue where you left off?

Reproducibility is all about communicating with your collaborators (peers, colleagues, and yourself!)

## Types of (R) projects

- One-off analysis script or notebook
- Complex analysis with multiple scripts
  - Product: paper or report
- R package

## How to make your work reproducible

- Project-oriented organization
- Describe the analysis workflow
- Define the dependencies
- Version control & sharing

::: {.notes}
These are tips you can adopt to improve the reproducibility of your work.
It isn't all or nothing; working towards any one of these is worthwhile!
:::

## Project-oriented organization

Scenario: you are given a new project with a dataset to analyze.
You create a new R Markdown / Quarto / Jupyter notebook for initial exploratory
analysis.

The initial results look promising, so you continue to pursue the analysis.

After a while, your original notebook is pretty messy with steps for data cleaning,
filtering, statistical analyses, and visualization all over the place and out of order.

Maybe you put your notebook in the same folder on your computer as another related but different analysis.
But those projects have diverged to answer very different questions,
and it's getting hard to keep track of which files go with which project.

It's time to get organized!

## Project-oriented organization: keep it contained

- Create a separate, self-contained folder for each project.
- Use a consistent subdirectory structure within the project folder

```
~/projects/lung-cancer
├── clinical-metadata-lung.csv
├── correlation-liver.R

## Project-oriented organization: use RStudio projects

Create `.Rproj` files with RStudio (`File > New project`)

```
~/projects
├── liver-cancer
│   ├── data
│   ├── figures
│   ├── liver-cancer.Rproj
│   ├── notebooks
│   └── scripts
└── lung-cancer
    ├── data
    ├── figures
    ├── lung-cancer.Rproj
    ├── notebooks
    └── scripts
```

`Rproj` contains project-specific settings and tells RStudio where the **root**
of your project is

## R projects enable better file path resolution

`~/projects/lung-cancer/scripts/heatmap.R`

:::{.column width="width=45%"}
``` r
library(tidyverse)

rna_counts <- read_csv('/Users/myusername/Desktop/lung-cancer/data/RNAseq-counts.csv')
```
:::

:::{.column width="width=45%"}
``` r
library(tidyverse)

rna_counts <- read_csv('data/RNAseq-counts.csv')
```
:::

Rproj tells RStudio that `~/projects/lung-cancer/` is the project root.

## R projects + {here}

:::{.column width="width=45%"}
``` r
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

rna_counts <- read_csv('data','RNAseq-counts.csv')
```
:::

:::{.notes}
to separate directories, mac and linux use forward slash `/`, but windows uses backslash `\`!
:::

## Project-oriented organization makes your projects portable

- With a consistent directory structure, you and your colleagues will be able to locate files they're looking for.
- With relative paths, others can run your code on their on computer without changing file paths.

## Describe the analysis workflow

In what order should you run these scripts?

```
lung-cancer/scripts
├── clean-data.R
├── feature-importance.R
├── heatmap.R
├── model-training.R
├── plot-performance.R
└── preprocess-data.R
```

## Describe the analysis workflow

You could rename the files with numbers

```
lung-cancer/scripts
├── 0_clean-data.R
├── 1_preprocess-data.R
├── 2_heatmap.R
├── 3_model-training.R
├── 4_plot-performance.R
└── 5_feature-importance.R
```

::::{.fragment}
Or perhaps describe the order in a README file

:::{.frame-box}
`README.md`

The scripts were run in the following order:

1. clean-data.R
1. preprocess-data.R
1. heatmap.R
1. model-training.R
1. plot-performance.R
1. feature-importance.R
:::

::::

:::{.notes}
but there's a better way!
:::

## ~Describe~ Automate the analysis workflow

Create a script to orchestrate the analysis

:::{.frame-box}
`lung-cancer/main.R`
``` r
library(here)
source(here('scripts', 'clean-data.R'))
source(here('scripts', 'preprocess-data.R'))
source(here('scripts', 'heatmap.R'))
source(here('scripts', 'model-training.R'))
source(here('scripts', 'plot-performance.R'))
source(here('scripts', 'feature-importance.R'))
```
:::

:::{.notes}
This could be as simple as a main R script that source your other scripts in the
correct order, or a full-blown workflow manager
:::


## ~Describe~ Automate the analysis workflow

For complex analyses, workflow managers orchestrate the execution and scale resources up or down as needed

- Snakemake
- Nextflow
- drake

:::{.notes}
TODO add logos

Use a workflow manager if:
If you need to repeat steps multiple times (e.g. model training),
some steps can be run in parallel, large analyses requiring a lot of resources,
if you need to use different languages + CLI tools...

Not necessary if your analysis is straightforward with just a few scripts that run sequentially
:::

## Describe the dependencies

If you use any packages outside of base R, you'll need to know which packages
and (possibly) which versions

## How to make your R projects reproducible {.hidden}

- Project-oriented organization
  - organize into directories for code, data, figures, notebooks
  - Every paper is a self-contained directory/folder.

    Put all of the figures, code, & data that go into a paper in one place.
    Keeps you organized while you're working on the project.
    Makes it easier to find what you're looking for later on.

  - Use `.Rproj` files: Enables relative paths rather than absolute paths to files. `{here}`

- Describe the analysis workflow
  - Describe steps to go from raw data through visualizations
  - Even better: automate the workflow
    - ideally, include a driver script / orchestrator. main.R, bash script, makefile, drake, Snakemake workflow, nextflow workflow

- Define the dependencies
    - list in the readme, description file, optionally use renv or conda

- Version control & sharing

## Conclusion

## My analysis is simple, do I really need all this?

No! Pick and choose what works for you and your peers
